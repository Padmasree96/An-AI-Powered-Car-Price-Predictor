# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
As someone just starting out in **Machine Learning**, I built this project to explore how algorithms can predict car prices based on real-world features like mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and year. I used **Linear Regression** to model the relationships and uncover insights—all while learning the full data science workflow hands-on.

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebook  
To try it out yourself:  
1. Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` notebook.  
2. Make sure Python is installed (I recommend using Anaconda).  
3. Install the required libraries:  
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```  
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells step by step.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
This is just the beginning! I’m planning to:  
- Compare models like Decision Trees and Random Forests  
- Try hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask  
- Add interactive visualizations to make insights more dynamic
